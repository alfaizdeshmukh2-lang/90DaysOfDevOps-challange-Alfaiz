DAY-02 TASK

Today’s goal is to understand how Linux works under the hood.

short note explaination:

1)The core components of Linux (kernel, user space, init/systemd)
Ans : a)Kernal:The kernal is the core part of an operating system.
      b)It acts as an bridge between hardware and the software.
      c)Without kernal application cant talk to hardware.
      
2)USER SPACE : User space is the restricted , protected memory area where all user application-like web browser, file manages, and terminal app-run.

3)a)init: init is the first process that starts after the Linux kernal boots 
          - PID OF UNIT = 1
          - IT starts all other services and process.
          - It contain system startup and shutdown.
  b) systemd : systemd is amodern replacement for init used in most linux distribation (UBUNTU , CENTOS , RHEL , AMAZON LINUX)

# Process Creation and Management in Linux
1)How processes are created and managed.
A process is a program that is currently running in memory.
Each process has:
1.PID (Process ID) – unique number
2.PPID (Parent Process ID) – the process that started it
3.Memory, CPU time, and resources.

2. How Processes Are Created in Linux
ans: Processes are mainly created using these system calls:
fork()
Creates a child process by copying the parent process.
Child gets a new PID.
exec()
Loads a new program into the process memory.
Often used after fork().

3. Process States in Linux
  a)A process can be in different states:
  b)Running (R) – currently executing
  c)Sleeping (S) – waiting for input
  d)Stopped (T) – paused
  e)Zombie (Z) – finished but not cleaned up

1. What is systemd?
2. Ans : systemd is the init system and service manager in modern Linux.
It is the first process started by the kernel (PID 1).

3. What systemd Does
ans:
1. Starts System Services
Examples:
-Networking
-SSH
-Logging
2. Manages Services
-systemctl start nginx
-systemctl stop nginx
-systemctl restart nginx

Short Interview Answer

Process creation:
In Linux, processes are created using fork() and exec(). The kernel manages them using scheduling, signals, and priorities.

systemd:
systemd is the first process (PID 1) that starts all services, manages them, handles booting, logging, and dependencies.
